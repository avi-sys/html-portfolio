<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
My name is Avi Thawait, and I’m a Junior at Marvin Ridge High School with a strong 
interest in technology, entrepreneurship, and biomedical engineering. 
I enjoy pushing myself in academics while staying involved in leadership,
service, and creative projects that allow me to grow and make a difference.
</p>

<p>I’m an active member of FBLA, DECA, TSA, Science Olympiad, and Speech and Debate. 
This year, I placed 4th in FBLA Website Design at the state level and competed at 
Nationals in Anaheim. ’m currently learning web and mobile app development from 
the ground up, focusing on mastering tools like Framer, Figma, and Swift for iOS apps.
My goal is to build professional-level applications without relying heavily on AI and 
to be fully prepared to compete in FBLA’s Mobile App Development event next year.</p>

<p>Outside of school, I’m deeply involved in community service and hands-on experiences. 
  I’ve completed over 100 volunteer hours with VTSEVA, the YMCA, and my Hindu center, 
  and I intern at Dishefs, a food-tech startup where I contribute to digital projects. 
  These experiences have strengthened my skills in leadership, teamwork, and real-world 
  problem-solving.</p>

  <p>
    I also have a strong athletic background. I swim competitively three times a week, play soccer, 
    and hold a black belt in karate.I also train in jujitsu and kickboxing, which have taught me 
    discipline, resilience, and focus. Whether it’s in coding, science, or sports, I’m always 
    looking for ways to grow and challenge myself.
